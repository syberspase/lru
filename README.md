## Simple implementation of LRU cache ##

There are 2 directories
* lru/leetcode:
    * Includes my Java and Python submissions accepted by leetcode (no peeking any discussion of that problem) at https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache .
    * You can copy and paste the code to leetcode to test either Java or Python solutions.
    * Evidences of acceptance are attached from leetcode.
* lru/mysolution:
    * Wraps my leetcode Java submission with standard maven project and tests.
    * You can import maven project to eclipse and run junit testsuite.
