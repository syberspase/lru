## Simple implementation of LRU cache ##

There are 2 directories
* lru/leetcode:
    * Includes my Java and Python submissions accepted by leetcode (no peeking any discussion of that problem) at https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache .
* lru/mysolution:
    * Wraps my leetcode Java submission with standard maven project and tests.
